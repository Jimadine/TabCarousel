        <h1>Welcome to TabCarousel!</h1>
        
        <p>TabCarousel is simple: open tabs you want to monitor throughout the day, then click the toolbar icon. To stop, click the icon again.</p>
        <p>By default, TabCarousel will flip through your tabs every 15 s (configurable), reloading them every 5 mins. It's great on a unused display or TV. Put Chrome in full-screen mode (F11, or cmd-shift-f on the Mac) and let it go.</p>
        <p>If you want to change how often TabCarousel flips through your tabs, right click on the toolbar icon and choose "Options".</p>
